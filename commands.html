do you ever get tired<br>
where do you live<br>
what do you eat<br>
do you have feelings<br>
do you like Siri/Cortana/Alexa/Google Assistant<br>
what do you look like<br>

do you like iphone<br>
what am I thinking<br>
what's the weather like<br>
Or you can ask for other things to get a response based on wikipedia. For example:
"Bill Gates",  "Mark Zuckerberg",  "Google", "Stonehenge" or everything you want!
